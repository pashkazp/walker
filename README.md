## Implementation of algorithm A*

This application is the result of one strange story with a test task and an interview in one IT company. Initially, there was a test task from the company in the style of "Death of a Perfectionist", which did not specify any desired frameworks, or methods of solution, or criteria for evaluating the result, or deadlines. There was only a requirement to write the implementation of algorithm A* and to show result. In addition, the company guaranteed me that I was not limited in time.

As it usually happens, at first it turned out that the deadline came tonight until yesterday. Then it turned out that the framework, and methods, and terms - all this mattered. It's just that someone must not have agreed on something... 

You can test the result yourself.

## To run the application

Build using maven goal (or by using maven wrapper): `mvn clean package` and execute the resulting artifact as follows `java -jar depavlo.walker.web/target/walker-web.jar`

You can then access application here: http://localhost:8080/
